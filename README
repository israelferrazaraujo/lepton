# Lepton
Lepton is an educational quantum simulator designed to run on small devices.

Lepton is a specialized quantum simulator designed for small devices, with two key objectives.
Firstly, it aims to be didactic by providing complete access to all mathematical routines and simulation steps in its easy-to-read source code.
Secondly, it is optimized to run efficiently on small devices, including 8-bit computers. Keeping a small device as a baseline can help ensure that the code remains simple and efficient.

Although it is not intended to replace existing quantum simulation libraries, such as Qiskit or Pennylane, Lepton offers a unique approach to quantum simulation that is both accessible and efficient.

## Authors
Lepton's first version was developed in a collaboration between [Quantum Data Science & AI lab](https://quantumpark.yonsei.ac.kr/) (also known as q-DNA) at Yonsei University and [Centro de Inform√°tica](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br) at UFPE.
